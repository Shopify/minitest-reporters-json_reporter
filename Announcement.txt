Docs:http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/minitest-reporters-json_reporter/1.0.0

minitest-reporters-json_reporter is an extension to the Ruby minitest-reporters gem that provides JSON output from your Minitest or MiniSpec test run.

Changes:
o Badges! We have stinkin' badges.
o Improved class/method documentation.
o README.md contains better and more 'jq' examples.

This version forms the foundation for the PR on the upstream minitest-reporters gem.

Abstract

JSON has become the lingua franca of interprogram communications. There are several  very good output formats
for Minitest, but no JSON format until now. If you want to hook up an IDE or some other automatic
framework like a CI or CD tool, it is natural to send output in some parsable format like XML or JSON. This extension summarizes the result of
a test run in  format like JSON.a test run in an easible consumable format.

Another use case is doing data mining on your test runs. Using a tool like 'jq',
you canspot trends, find long running tests and group test failures in some
order.

Usage is very simple. Just require 'minitest/reporters/json_reporter' in your 
test_helper.rb or spec_helper.rb.
Then, you should also invoke the use! method of Minitest::Reporters class
with a call to Minitest::Reporters::JsonReporter.new. 
Here is an example test_helper.rb:
# ... Other requires

require 'minitest/reporters/json_reporter'
require 'minitest/autorun'

Minitest::Reporters.use! [Minitest::Reporters::JsonReporter.new]
# ...
# End of test_helper.rb

Here is the URLs for the dependent gems:

minitest  : https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest
minitest-reporters  : https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest-reporters

The JSON format is sent to stdout when you run a test or all tests.
You can customize where the JSON file is written by setting the :io attribute. It must be some IO stream.
You can see the format of the JSON created by looking at the Home page on GitHub: https://github.com/edhowland/minitest-reporters-json_reporter

You can use JSON parsing tools to get elements or subsets of this format. One such tool is JQ: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

Here is how you might view only the color of the test:

$ ruby blog_test.rb  | jq -r .status.color
green

If you want to customize the format of the JSON string, you only need to subclass the Minitest::Reporters::JsonReporter class
and override the to_h method. See the file README.md for an example on this.

If you find this gem useful, please send me a note about how you are using it.
I would be interested if you are hooking it up to an automated framework like CI, CD or a code editor or IDE.

Thanks, Ed
