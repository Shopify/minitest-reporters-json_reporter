minitest-reporters-json_reporter is an extension to the Ruby minitest-reporters gem that provides JSON output from your MiniTest or MiniSpec test run.
JSON has become the lingua franca of interprogram communications. There are several  very good output formats
for MiniTest, but no JSON format until now. If you want to hook up an IDE or some other automatic
framework, it is natural to send output in some parsable format like XML or JSON. This extension summarizes the result of
a test run in  format like JSON.a test run in an easible consumable format.


Usage is very simple. Just require 'minitest/reporters/json_reporter' in your test_helper.rb or spec_helper.rb.
This gem also depends on 'minitest' and 'minitest/reporters'.  Then, you should also invoke the use! method of MiniTest::Reporters class with a call to MiniTest::Reporters::JsonReporter.new. 
Here is an example test_helper.rb:

require 'minitest/reporters/json_reporter'
# ... Other requires
require 'minitest/autorun'

MiniTest::Reporters.use! [MiniTest::Reporters::JsonReporter.new]
